## Beats & Games - Find your music, find your games
This repository holds the active development state of the project and is NOT representative of what the codebase will look like prior to and after deployment.


# What is this app?
Beats & Games is a simple social platform made with Python-Django where users can post their Spotify playlists and associate them with games available on the IGBD website. Then other users can search for playlists that are tagged with a specific game in order to find new playlists to listen to while playing that game. Users can customize the list of tagged games as well as add/edit descriptions of the music and why it works for a certain set of games beyond the spotify caption. Likes and comments are actively being worked on.
